## FAQ

Q: When clicking an actor in the scene I get error message `This Token references an Actor which no langer exists within the World`  
A: Yeah. Just delete it and drag it again from the actor tab. I didn't figure our how to make this work (PR welcome). It still kept it in there so you can see there to place which actors.
